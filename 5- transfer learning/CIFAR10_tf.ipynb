Transfer learning is a technique where a pre-trained model is used as a feature extractor for a new task. In this case, we are using the ResNet50 model, which has been pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, to extract features from the CIFAR-10 images.\n","\n","## Import Libraries\n","\n","We start by importing the necessary libraries.\n","\n","```python\n","import tensorflow as tf\n","from tensorflow.keras import datasets, layers, models\n","from tensorflow.keras.applications import ResNet50\n","```\n","\n","## Load and Preprocess Data\n","\n","We load the CIFAR-10 dataset and normalize the pixel values to be between 0 and 1.\n","\n","```python\n","(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = datasets.cifar10.load_data()\n","train_images, test_images = train_images / 255.0, test_images / 255.0\n","```\n","\n","We then create `tf.data.Dataset` objects for the training and test data, shuffle and batch the training data, and batch the test data.\n","\n","```python\n","train_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((train_images, train_labels))\n","train_dataset = train_dataset.shuffle(buffer_size=1024).batch(32)\n","test_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((test_images, test_labels))\n","test_dataset = test_dataset.batch(32)\n","```\n","\n","## Define the Model\n","\n","We define the model architecture using the ResNet50 model as a feature extractor and a custom classifier.\n","\n","### Feature Extractor\n","\n","The feature extractor is defined as a function that takes the input images and returns the output of the ResNet50 model with the top layers removed.\n","\n","```python\n","def feature_extractor(inputs):\n","    feature_extractor = ResNet50(input_shape=(224, 224, 3),\n","                                 include_top=False,\n","                                 weights='imagenet')(inputs)\n","    return feature_extractor\n","```\n","\n","### Classifier\n","\n","The classifier is defined as a function that takes the output of the feature extractor and returns the final classification output.
